 1)   The some() and every() methods in JavaScript are used to check the elements of an array based on a specific condition. They differ in their behavior and the result they return.

    The some() method returns true if at least one element in the array satisfies the given condition. It stops iterating through the array as soon as it finds the first satisfying element. If none of the elements pass the condition, it returns false.

    On the other hand, the every() method returns true only if all elements in the array satisfy the given condition. It continues iterating through the entire array and stops immediately if it encounters the first element that fails the condition. If any element fails the condition, it returns false.

    Both methods take a callback function as an argument, which defines the condition for evaluating the elements. The callback function is executed for each element of the array and should return a Boolean value.

    To summarize, some() checks if at least one element meets the condition and returns true, while every() checks if all elements meet the condition and returns true. They differ in their stopping behavior and the overall outcome they provide.
